fMRI selected areas binarized

Contains files for all 8 subjects corresponding to regions 3 - 16, 59 -62, and 81 - 90.

Some of the files had to be compressed because they were too big.

Participant 2 misses the file for Region 60.

The files are post-processed for hemodynamic response delay, words with no imageability ratings have been excluded and the the imageability ratings in the last column have been binarized.

An additional file containing the selected voxels paired with ELMo embeddings is also added.
